# BlueEdTech_M1

Repository for display and storage of the educational content developed at Blue Edtech. This repository covers the first module of the data science track. The main contents of this module are: variables, operations, conditional statements, repetition statements and pandas. 

For the most part, this module was developed in Orange software (https://orangedatamining.com) to explain the basics of data science, so most of the lessons are not present in this repository.

All documents (this file being the only exception) are in Brazilian Portuguese.
