# BlueEdTech_M1

Repository for display and storage of the educational content developed at Blue Edtech. This repository covers the first module of the data science track. The main contents of this module are: variables, operations, conditional statements, repetition statements and pandas. 

The "Aulas" and "Codelabs" folders are just to keep track of the module content and are not properly commented and explained.

The "Projetos" folder holds the projects that are properly commented and explained.

The "Datasets" folder holds some of the datasets used, all datasets can be found on the internet, so only some will be stored in this repository.

For the most part, this module was developed in Orange software (https://orangedatamining.com) to explain the basics of data science, so most of the lessons are not present in this repository.

Some lessons were developed in groups, and since they were not completely done by me they will not be present in this repository.

All documents (this file being the only exception) are in Brazilian Portuguese.
